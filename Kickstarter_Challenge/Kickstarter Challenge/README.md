# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
	In this challenge, we are assisting Louise in a crowdfunding campaign for her play Fever. She wants to raise $10,000 and would like to know the best, most efficient way to manage this campaign.
	We are using Excel to analyze, sort, and organize the data for Louise so the right Kickstarter campaign will work best for her.


### Purpose

 Louise wanted to analyze her kickstarter campaigns and see which ones were most successful.
The purpose of this data was to create a detailed report using visuals, tables, and other data, specifically focusing on the genre of theater since she was specifically interested in starting a campaign for theaters.

By performing different tasks and creating diffent visual tables, louise will be able to quickly analyze the data and she will be able to pinpoint those most similar to her vision.


## Analysis and Challenges

    The challenges that I experienced throughout this work were my own personal challenges of learning a more advanced style of Excel.

It is a matter of me becoming more comfortable with using new formulas, codes, datasets, and seeing the results.

Another challenge would be performing a formula incorrectly and not getting the resluts that were intended. This will happen but with more practice and having a second set of eyes looking at the results, accuracy will improve.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

	From the data presented, we see the most successful year was 2015. What we also see in the data chart is that there were more successful campaigns than failed ones.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

	From what the data chart presents, the most successful campaigns were at the lower dollar amount (<$1,000 to 4999) as well as $35.000 to 50,000. Most of the failed campaigns happened at dollar amounts well above the $50,000 mark.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

	Challenges and difficulties found during our research was narrowing down the field to the most successful campaigns. When looking at the data, Louise and her team have to prepare for certain dollar amount requests and understand that if she wants to raise $10,000, the lower amounts will be best.

## Results

-Two conclusions that can be drawn from the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date are 
    -1. The bulk of campaigns in the June and July are most successful
    -2. The least successful were in December

-A conclusion based off of the Outcomes based on Goals would be the amounts at $5000 or less had the highest number of successes.
    -1.This particular dollar amount is much more attainable
    -2.More companies can contribute at this amount 

-Limitations are not seeing exactly where the money is coming from. Louise would not know by looking at the tables where to target her campaign.

-Limitation regarding this dataset would be the inclusion of all theaters in the original dataset. Also analyzing the average donations that certain plays received.
    -1.Knowing the average donation could make the campaign more targeted
    -2.The campaign could use an average as a means to set up gifts with certain amounts of donations Similar to public broadcasting and their gifts with donations.
